# APOE-Gene-Cloning-In-Silico
In silico molecular cloning of the Human APOE gene using SnapGene. Features primer design, restriction mapping, and the construction of pBluescript and pET-28a recombinant plasmids for protein expression and GFP reporter assays

## 🧬 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive *in silico* workflow for cloning and expressing the Human **Apolipoprotein E (APOE)** gene. Using **SnapGene**, I simulated high-precision genetic engineering tasks, including sequence retrieval, restriction analysis, and the construction of multi-functional recombinant vectors.

The project follows a structured molecular biology pipeline to create tools for gene storage, protein expression, and transcriptional regulation studies.

## 📋 Project Objectives & Workflow
The project was executed in the following stages based on the academic requirements:

### 1. Sequence Acquisition & Analysis
* **Gene of Interest:** Human APOE (retrieved from NCBI).
* **Components:** GFP reporter gene, pBluescript (cloning vector), and pET-28a (expression vector).
* **Restriction Mapping:** Analyzed all sequences to identify unique, double, and zero-cutters to ensure directional cloning without internal gene disruption.

### 2. Primer Design & PCR Simulation
* Designed specific primers for the amplification of the APOE gene, its promoter region, and the GFP gene.
* **Feature:** Primers were engineered with 5' restriction site overhangs compatible with the destination vectors.
* Developed standardized PCR programs for each amplification cycle.

### 3. Vector Construction (pBluescript - Cloning Phase)
* **Plasmid Map 1:** Complete APOE gene cloned into pBluescript (pBS).
* **Plasmid Map 2:** GFP gene cloned under the control of the APOE native promoter in pBS.
* **Plasmid Map 3:** Fusion construct (APOE + GFP) in pBS for protein localization studies.

### 4. Expression Vector Design (pET-28a - Production Phase)
* Transitioned constructs into pET expression vectors for heterologous protein production in *E. coli*.
* **Plasmid Map 4:** APOE gene into pET-28a expression system.
* **Plasmid Map 5A:** APOE Promoter + GFP into pET vector.
* **Plasmid Map 5B:** APOE Gene + GFP fusion into pET vector.
